# Sales Dashboard — Excel Project

**Project:** Sales Dashboard (Excel)
**File:** `final sales.xlsm`

## Overview

This project is a sales dashboard built in Microsoft Excel. It cleans a transactional sales dataset, performs aggregations, and displays interactive dashboards and slicers. The workbook uses macros (VBA) to automate tasks and improve interactivity.

## Features

* Data cleaning and transformation (duplicates removal, formatting)
* Pivot tables for sales by product, region, and time period
* Interactive charts and slicers for quick filtering
* Macro-enabled automations (report refresh, export)
* Summary KPIs: Total Sales, Average Order Value, Top Products, Monthly Trend

## Files in this repository

* `final sales.xlsm` — Main Excel workbook (macro-enabled).
* `README.md` — This file.

## System requirements

* Microsoft Excel (Windows or Mac) — macros require desktop Excel for full functionality.
* Enable macros to use automated features: Excel → Trust Center → Macro Settings → Enable macros (or enable per-file on open).

## How to use

1. Download and open `final sales.xlsm` in Excel.
2. If prompted, enable macros.
3. Go to the Dashboard worksheet and use the slicers to filter by date, product, or region.
4. To refresh data: Data → Refresh All (or use the 'Refresh' macro button if provided).

## Notes & precautions

* **Do not** upload confidential or personal data to a public repository. Use sample/anonymized data instead.
* If your file is larger than 100 MB, GitHub will not accept it via normal git — use GitHub Releases or Git LFS.
